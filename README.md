This is a project to recreate wordle that you can play infinitely and for free. 

Simply load the page and a word will be chosen. Refresh or click the New Word Button to get another word.

Seed support allows you to send a 'word' to someone else so you can do the same word. 

Endurance mode is an 'endless' mode where a new word will automatically be chosen and the previous word will be inputted as your first guess.  This is to encourage varied starts.
